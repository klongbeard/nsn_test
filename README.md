## Thoughts, Outcomes, etc.

Overall I compeleted 18/20 tasks in about 2hr 20mins. I know the suggested time was 2 hours, but I got a flow going and was happy to do a little bit more to see how much I could complete. 

Below is a complete list of what I completed:

- [x] Add more padding around the header
- [x] There should be a border under the header but it doesn't seem to be working. Could you fix this please?
- [x] Could we make the black background of the footer go right to the edges of the screen please?
- [x] In the footer, could you move home, privacy, terms and contact over to the right
- [x] Could you make the footer links white as well please
- [x] I can't remember how we got the home icon there. But could you find out and pick some appropriate icons to add to privacy, terms and contact as well please.
- [ ] Can you make it so the links are centered in a new line in the footer on mobile
- [x] Can we display the university results in a grid, four per line, rather than in a row.
- [x] Can we format the results more nicely. Maybe make the university name bigger and bolder and in a different colour.
- [x] Can we make it so that on a mobile phone they display in a single column though.


- [x] When filtering the list of universities, most universities seem to appear twice
- [x] When I search for "cambridge" or "manchester" it doesn't find anything. Why not? And can you fix this?
- [x] Could we also include the list of web domains for each university in the results box
- [ ] The search seems a bit slow at the moment. Can we speed this up?
- [x] At the moment when people save a university, they can only save one. Can you may it so they can save as many as they'd like?
- [x] When you start searching and then delete everything from the search field, you're left with all the results. Can you please make it so that when the search bar is empty there are no results.
- [x] Can you limit the number of results shown to 20.
- [x] When you first load the page, can you make it so that it shows all the saved universities
- [x] Can you make sure the delete button still works on the saved favourites
- [x] Can you make it so the Delete button only shows up in the results if that university is saved as a favourite and only deletes that one.
