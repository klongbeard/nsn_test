## Background

This is a small example project that lets users search through a list of UK universities and "save" their favourite ones. It calls an API to get the list of universities and displays them on the page.

You should be able to run it on your local machine just by opening index.html in your browser.

It uses a CSS Framework called Bulma. The documentation for Bulma is here: https://bulma.io/documentation/form/general/ Please don't add any additional dependencies to the project.

## Task

We'd like you to have a go at the 10 CSS tasks and 10 JavaScript tasks below. We don't expect you to have used Bulma, but we'd like you to look at the code and the documentation and figure out how it works. We're looking to see whether you can read documentation for unfamiliar services and apply that knowledge to an unfamiliar codebase.

We're not looking for you to spend ages on this task (the code is a sample project made specifically for this task, not real production code). We'd recommend you spend no more than a couple of hours. We don't necessarily expect you to complete every task. We've intentionally added plenty of activities so that if you get stuck on one you can move to a different one instead.

Please use Google, Stack Overflow or any resources you'd usually use. The aim of the exercise is to try to create real world troubleshooting, not a test of memory.

Once you've completed the task, please zip up your final files and email them back to us.

## CSS

1. Add more padding around the header
2. There should be a border under the header but it doesn't seem to be working. Could you fix this please?
3. Could we make the black background of the footer go right to the edges of the screen please?
4. In the footer, could you move home, privacy, terms and contact over to the right
5. Could you make the footer links white as well please
6. I can't remember how we got the home icon there. But could you find out and pick some appropriate icons to add to privacy, terms and contact as well please.
7. Can you make it so the links are centered in a new line in the footer on mobile
8. Can we display the university results in a grid, four per line, rather than in a row.
9. Can we format the results more nicely. Maybe make the university name bigger and bolder and in a different colour.
10. Can we make it so that on a mobile phone they display in a single column though.

## JS

1. When filtering the list of universities, most universities seem to appear twice
2. When I search for "cambridge" or "manchester" it doesn't find anything. Why not? And can you fix this?
3. Could we also include the list of web domains for each university in the results box
4. The search seems a bit slow at the moment. Can we speed this up?
5. At the moment when people save a university, they can only save one. Can you may it so they can save as many as they'd like?
6. When you start searching and then delete everything from the search field, you're left with all the results. Can you please make it so that when the search bar is empty there are no results.
7. Can you limit the number of results shown to 20.
8. When you first load the page, can you make it so that it shows all the saved universities
9. Can you make sure the delete button still works on the saved favourites
10. Can you make it so the Delete button only shows up in the results if that university is saved as a favourite and only deletes that one.
